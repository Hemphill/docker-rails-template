# Template: Rails

This template is based on the tutorial [Quickstart: Compose and Rails](https://docs.docker.com/compose/rails/) on the docker website and allows you to create a new rails app or convert an existing rails app over to docker.

## How to create a new rails app using this template

1. Duplicate this template directory and rename it as appropriate for your project.
2. Change the ruby version identified in this template's `Dockerfile` to the version desired.
3. Change the rails version identified in this template's `Gemfile` to the version desired.
4. Modify existing `config/database.yml` for the `development` and `test` environments. Change the `host` values to `db` (the name of the docker-compose db service). Be sure to use `root` as the database `username`. The `config/database.yml` for the `development` and `test` environments should look like the following.

    ```yaml
    default: &default
      adapter: mysql2
      encoding: utf8
      pool: 5
      username: root
      password: password
      host: db
    ``` 
5. Run the following command which will create the docker container, install the minimal gems necessary to create a rails app, then actually create the rails app: 

   ```bash
   $ docker-compose run web rails new . --force --database=mysql --skip-bundle
   ```
6. Run the following command to rebuild the image with the new gems.  You should re-run this command any time you change the Gemfile.   

   ```bash
   $ docker-compose build
   ```
7. Replace the generated `config/database.yml` with the `config/sample_database.yml` file from this template.  Be sure to change the `database` names for each environment to match up with the values in the docker-compose.yml file.
8. Run the following command to start the rails instance.

   ```bash
   $ docker-compose up
   ```
   
9. Before opening the app in the browser, create the development & test database by running:  

   ```bash
   docker-compose run --rm web rake db:setup
   ```
   
10. Verify database connection works from rails console: 
   
    ```
    docker-compose run --rm web rails c
    
    Loading development environment (Rails 4.2.3)

    irb(main):001:0> ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection
    
    => #<ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::ConnectionPool:0x005593520f6460 @mon_owner=nil, @mon_count=0, @mon_mutex=#<Thread::Mutex:0x005593520f63e8>, @spec=#<ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::ConnectionSpecification:0x005593520f8f08 @config={:adapter=>"mysql2", :database=>"core_development", :pool=>5, :username=>"rails", :password=>"password", :host=>"db"}, @adapter_method="mysql2_connection">, @checkout_timeout=5, @reaper=#<ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::ConnectionPool::Reaper:0x005593520f6370 @pool=#<ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::ConnectionPool:0x005593520f6460 ...>, @frequency=nil>, @size=5, @reserved_connections=#<ThreadSafe::Cache:0x005593520f62d0 @backend={}, @default_proc=nil>, @connections=[], @automatic_reconnect=true, @available=#<ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::ConnectionPool::Queue:0x005593520f6118 @lock=#<ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::ConnectionPool:0x005593520f6460 ...>, @cond=#<MonitorMixin::ConditionVariable:0x005593520f6000 @monitor=#<ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::ConnectionPool:0x005593520f6460 ...>, @cond=#<Thread::ConditionVariable:0x005593520f5e48>>, @num_waiting=0, @queue=[]>>
    ```  
    
    If you get an error stating that the mysql2 gem is missing (even tho it is not) then you may be using a version of rails 3 or 4 that has a bug.  Try changing the Gemfile with the following line: 
     
   ```ruby
   gem 'mysql2', '0.3.20'
   ```
11. Open the app in your web browser: http://localhost:3000/
12. To stop the rails server, hit ctrl-c.


## How to update an existing rails app to use this template

1. Copy `docker-compose.yml` and `Dockerfile` over from this template to your project.
2. Change the `Dockerfile` Ruby version as desired.
3. Change the `docker-compose.yml` `environment` settings `MYSQL_*` to your desired values. Note that the `MYSQL_DATABASE` database will be created when the db image is first built.

4. Modify existing `config/database.yml` for the `development` and `test` environments. Change the `host` values to `db` (the name of the docker-compose db service). Be sure to use `root` as the database `username`. The `config/database.yml` for the `development` and `test` environments should look like the following.

    ```yaml
    default: &default
      adapter: mysql2
      encoding: utf8
      pool: 5
      username: root
      password: password
      host: db
``` 

5. Run the following command to rebuild the image with the new gems.  You should re-run this command any time you change the `Gemfile`.

   ```bash
   $ docker-compose build
   ```
6. Before opening the app in the browser, create the development & test database by running:  

   ```bash
   docker-compose run --rm web rake db:setup
   ```
   
7. Copy database data from your old db to the new docker db.
   1. Create an mysql dump of your database from your old mysql instance (alternatively, Sequel Pro can do this).  The dump file should be in SQL format and contain both schema and content.
   
      ```
      $ docker-compose run --rm db mysqldump -h hostname -u rails -p --result-file=/myapp/dump.sql database_name
      ```
      
      This command will connect to the database at `hostname` with user `rails` and create a `dump.sql` file in the current project directory.  It will prompt for the password.
   2. Copy this dump file to your project dir which is shared with the docker container.
   3. Make sure that the docker-compose 'db' service is running first: 
   
      ```bash
      $ docker-compose up db
      ```
   4. Import the dump file into the docker db:  
   
      ```bash
      $ docker-compose run --rm db mysql -h db -u root --password=password development < development.sql
      ```
      Note that the password must be specified in the command since the development.yml file is being redirected to stdin for the import.
8. Verify that database looks good from rails console:

    ```
    docker-compose run --rm web rails c
    ```
9. Start the rails app:

    ```
    docker-compose up
    ```

## RubyMine Docker Integration Setup

RubyMine starting with verison 2017.1 can work well with a Rails project that has been setup using the above instructions.  The following shows you how to configure the project to work within RubyMine.

First, we will setup a static IP for your laptop that can always be accessed from the container regardless of what wifi network you are currently connected to.  This avoids issues with dynamic IPs and the host IP specified in your project's `config/database.yml` file.

Then, we will setup a RubyMine with a Docker deployment, deployment runtime configuration, and a remote Ruby SDK for Docker.

Before doing any of the following, be sure to stop your docker-compose containers if they are already running:

```bash
$ docker-compose stop
```

### Configure Static IP

1. Execute the following on the command line in order to associate '192.168.111.111' with your laptop's loopback interface.
   ```bash
   $ sudo ifconfig lo0 alias 192.168.111.111
   ```
2. Modify 'config/database.yml' changing all the 'host' values to '192.168.111.111'

### Setup RubyMine

1. Add the 'Docker integration' plugin in Settings > Plugins then click the 'Install JetBrains plugin...'
2. Add a Docker deployment in Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Docker by clicking the '+' button.
   1. Change the 'API URL' to: "unix:///var/run/docker.sock" (when using Docker for Mac)
   2. Clear the 'Certificates folder' field
   3. Set the 'Docker Compose executable' to "/usr/local/bin/docker-compose"
3. Create docker deployment runtime configuration
   1. Select Run > Edit Configurations...
   2. Click the '+' button and select 'Docker Deployment' from the options
   3. Name the deployment "Docker Deployment"
   4. Select the 'Server' that you created in step 2 (probably "Docker")
   5. Select the 'Deployment' type of "docker-compose.yml"
   6. Click 'OK'
4. Run the docker deployment (build & start the containers)
   1. Select "Docker Deployment" from the runtime configurations list in the toolbar
   2. Click the run button.  
   This will open the 'Docker' tool window.  You can see the deployed containers and their logs here.  You can also stop/restart/redeploy the Docker containers here.  For example, after changing the Gemfile, you would want to click the 'Compose: docker-compose.yml' node and click the 'Redeploy' button on the left in order to rebuild the gems and restart the containers.
5. Add a remote Ruby SDK in Settings > Languages & Frameworks > Ruby SDK and Gems by clicking the '+' button and selecting 'New remote...'
   1. Select 'Docker' as the Remote Ruby Interpreter type
   2. Select the 'Server' name that you created in step 2 (probably "Docker")
   3. Select the 'Image name' that was created by running the deployment in step 4. This image will default to the name of the rails project directory (without spaces) with the docker-compose service name ("web") appended after an "_" then followed by a ":latest". (eg: "testrails_web:latest").
   4. You should be able to leave the 'Ruby interpreter path' as its default "ruby"
   5. Click 'OK' then wait a few secs as RubyMine connects to the container and retrieves the list of deployed gems.
